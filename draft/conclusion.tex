\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We demonstarated that even the absolute performance of standalone
applications achieved by our Gdev prototype is not very inferior to that
achieved by NVIDIA proprietary software. 

The Gdev prototype and the application programs used in our evaluation
are all open-source and may be downloaded from
{\sf http://github.com/shinpei0208/gdev} (this is temporal and subject
to change later).
