This paper has presented Gdev, a new approach to GPU resource management
that integrates runtime support into the OS.
Gdev also provides memory management and scheduling schemes
for the GPU to enable GPUs to be used as first-class computing
resources in time-sharing systems.
We implemented a prototype of Gdev, and conducted thorough experiments
to demonstrate the advantage and disadvantage of our Gdev approach. 
Our conclusion is that some basic performance needs to be compromised
due to moving runtime support into the OS, but GPU resources can be
efficiently shared among users in time-sharing systems, using Gdev.

Our Gdev prototype and the application programs used in our experiments
are open-source, and may be downloaded from {\sf
