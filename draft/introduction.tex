Existing OS-level solutions still rely on user-space runtime
engines, which provide application programming interfaces (APIs), to
generate GPU commands, and hence they never allow OSes directly to use
GPUs as first-class compute resources.
Those existing solutions also lack support for virtual memory
management, inter-process communication, and resource partitioning in
multi-tasking environments.
