\section{System Model and Assumption}
\label{sec:model}

There are two types of host-device memory copy operations.
Synchronous memory copy operations block host programs on the CPU until
copy is done, and could also block themselves on the GPU if other memory
copy operations or some device programs are still running.
Asynchronous memory copy operations, on the other hand, block neither
host programs on the CPU nor device programs on the GPU.

Launching device programs onto the GPU is a non-blocking operation in
host programs, while copying memory between the host and device is
either syncmemorycopy operations.
The host programs that have launched device programs are blocked only
when they explicitly call synchronization functions.

Multiple device programs are allowed to execute simultaneously on the
GPU, if they belong to the same context.
