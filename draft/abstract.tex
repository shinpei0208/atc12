\begin{abstract}
 The graphics processing unit (GPU) has become a very powerful platform
 embracing a concept of heterogeneous computing with many-core
 technology.

 We present Gdev, a new approach to GPU resource management, which
 enables the operating system (OS) and user-space applications to use
 GPUs as first-class computing resources.
 Gdev employs compute runtime in the OS, tightly coordinated with the
 device driver to enhance GPU resource management and extend a class of
 applications that can benefit from GPUs.
