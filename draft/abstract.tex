 The graphics processing unit (GPU) has become a very powerful platform
 embracing a concept of heterogeneous many-core computing.
 Despite its significant benefits in performance, however, the
 application domains of GPUs are currently limited, largely due to
 a lack of resource management primitives to support GPUs in
 time-sharing general-purpose environments.

 In this paper, we present Gdev, a new approach to GPU resource management in the
 operating system (OS), which enables user-space applications and the OS
 itself to use

 We present Gdev, a new approach to GPU resource management, which
 enables the operating system (OS) and user-space applications to use
 GPUs as first-class computing resources.
 Gdev employs compute runtime in the OS, tightly coordinated with the
 device driver to enhance GPU resource management and extend a class of
 applications that can benefit from GPUs.
