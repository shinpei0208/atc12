This paper has presented Gdev, a new approach to GPU resource management
that integrates runtime support into the OS.
This runtime-unified OS approach realizes new memory management and
scheduling schemes that enable a wide class of applications to GPUs as
first-class computing resources in general-purpose multi-tasking systems.
We implemented a prototype system of Gdev, and conducted thorough
experiments to demonstrate the advantage and disadvantage of using our
Gdev approach. 
Our conclusion is that Gdev needs to compromise some basic performance
due to incorporating runtime support in the OS, but can enhance GPU resource
management for multi-tasking systems and allow the OS itself to use
GPUs for computations.

Our prototype system and application programs used in the performance
evaluation are all open-source, and may be downloaded from our website~\cite{Gdev}.
