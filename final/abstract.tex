\begin{abstract}
 The graphics processing unit (GPU) has become a very powerful platform 
 embracing a concept of heterogeneous many-core computing.
 However, the benefit of GPUs is currently limited to specific
 application domains, largely due to a lack of ``first-class'' GPU
 resource management capabilities for general-purpose multi-tasking
 systems.

 We present Gdev, a new ecosystem of GPU resource management in the
 operating system (OS), which allows the user space and the OS
 itself to use GPUs as first-class computing resources.
 More specifically, Gdev enables GPU contexts to allocate device memory
 exceeding the physical space and share the memory resource with other contexts
 for inter-process communication (IPC).
 Gdev also supports GPU scheduling to virtualize the GPU into logical
 GPUs and control resource usage in computation and data movement,
 providing a strong isolation among GPU contexts and users in
 multi-tasking systems.

 Our evaluation using an open-source implementation of Gdev with Linux
 and an NVIDIA GPU shows that Gdev is competitive to proprietary
 software even in basic performance.
 In addition, for instance, we gain about a 2x speedup for an encrypted
 file system by allowing the OS to use the GPU.
 The shared device memory scheme also improves makespans of data-flow
 programs by up to 49\%, and an error in the utilization of virtualized
 GPUs provided by Gdev is limited within 7\%.
